<body><h1>Amazing grace</h1>

<h3>Sol majeur</h3>
Paroles: John Newton<br>Arrangement: Olivier Nussl√©<br><p><img border="0" src="zl-a87411c01452.png" alt="Amazing grace"></p><p><b>1.</b>  Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,<br>
that saved a wretch like me!<br>
I once was lost but now am found,<br>
was blind but now I see.<br>
<p><b>2.</b>  'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
and grace my fears relieved;<br>
how precious did that grace appear<br>
the hour I first believed!<br>
<p><b>3.</b>  Through many dangers, toils, and snares,<br>
I have already come;<br>
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br>
and grace will lead me home.<br>
<p><b>4.</b>  Praise God, praise God, praise God,<br>
Praise God, praise God, praise God,<br>
Praise God, praise God, praise God,<br>
was blind but now I see.
